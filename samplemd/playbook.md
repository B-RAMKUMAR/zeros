# Phase 0: Exploration

**Author:** Mu Sigma Labs

**Objective:** Build a team of decision scientists with extraordinary focus, strength, and rhythm. Inspired by neural networks, they learn through continuous error loops and backpropagation. Training is driven by atomic incentivizations, fostering growth via differential asynchronous scoring. Together, they evolve with precision, agility, and dynamic feedback.

## Weekly Schedule

| S.No | Activity | Details | Day |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | The Zeros Journey To Become One | Discuss Program Journey and expectations | Day 1 (only Week 1) |
| 2 | Task Allocation | Every trainee will be assigned the same task to complete by the end of the day. Each trainee must complete the task independently, without collaboration. | Day 1 (All 8 weeks) |
| 3 | Query and Challenges | Discussion with leadership team for any task-related queries | Day 2 (from week 2) |
| 4 | Feedback Session | Trainees - Share experience from previous week | Day 2 (from week 2) |
| 5 | Task Output Submission | Trainees expected to upload their Deliverables (Research document, Final presentation etc) to platform | Day 4 (by 11:59 PM) |
| 6 | Review | Upon completion, each trainee must present their output to any employee on the Musigma floor, who will review and assign a score based on the quality of work. | Day 5 |

## Task Details

### Task Overview
**Journey of Learning Framework & Skill Development Tasks**

This document outlines the phases of skill acquisition and the associated task breakdown for effective execution and mastery in any skill domain. The framework is designed to be simple, generic, and adaptable across projects with an estimated effort of ~2 days for initial familiarization and application.

**Key Learning Phases:**
- Not Aware
- Introduced (Use stories, content)
- Don’t Like (Build atomic units & muscle memory)
- Like (Integrate into lifestyle, daily routines, social media, channels, create outputs)
- Proud (Get validation, replicate real deliverables)
- Mastery (Cycle with intent and structure reflecting mastery to others)

**Associated Task Breakdown (T1–T9):**
- **T1:** Requirement Gathering (BRD)
- **T2:** Requirement Interpretation (BRD)
- **T3:** Requirement Assessment and Alignment (BPF x BRDs)
- **T4:** Effort Estimation (Gantt)
- **T5:** Effort Alignment (Gantt)
- **T6:** Execution (EDA, Data Movement, Insights, Consumption Tools, LLM applications, Agents, Advanced Math)
- **T7:** Quality Assurance (QC Checklists)
- **T8:** Deliverable Packaging (Identifying SOTA)
- **T9:** Deliverable Benchmarking & Communication (Reviews, Scoring, Email crafting, Links, Attachments)

### Task Allocation Process (Weekly)
- Each trainee (T1 to T9) will be assigned a phase or task through the portal on Day 1.
- Trainees are expected to complete their assigned tasks independently via self-learning and by accessing all relevant portal resources for guidance.
- Deliverables must be submitted by the deadline mentioned in the task instructions (EOD).

### Additional Guidelines
- **Planning is the gamechanger:** Focus on structured preparation for each task
- **Dignity of work:** Adopt discipline and pride as seen in defense training paradigms
- **Vulnerability and Humility:** Encouraged to openly acknowledge unknowns and seek help without hesitation

## Review

- Each trainee can receive a review for their day-to-day tasks or weekly tasks.
- Reviews will be provided by Mu Sigma employees, starting from the TDS2 position up to AL level.
- The review score will increase in geometric progression based on the reviewer’s experience level.

## Scoring Logic

**IMP NOTE:** DO NOT USE THIS SHEET DIRECTLY. RIGHT_CLICK on the tab, Copy to Another file. And use that file to get the scores for your respective tasks, from respective scorers. NAMING the NEW FILE: Keep the file name is the following format: `<Candidate's alphabet>_DAY<Day number>_TASK<Task number>_SCORER<Scorer number>`. For example: `R_DAY2_TASK1_SCORER3`.

### Scoring Sheet
| Candidate Name | Candidate Alphabet | Task ID | Task name | Deliverable | Who scored | Scorer's Name | Depth score (0-10) | Relevance score (0-10) | Applicability (0-10) | Authenticity/Novelty (0-10) | Packaging (0-10) |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| | | | | | Scorer 1 (AI) | AI | | | | | |
| | | | | | Scorer 2 (Prafulla) | Prafulla (or Prafulla's proxy) | | | | | |
| | | | | | Scorer 3 (mandatory) | | | | | | |
| | | | | | Scorer 4 (mandatory) | | | | | | |
| | | | | | Scorer 5 (mandatory) | | | | | | |
| | | | | | Scorer 6 (optional) | | | | | | |
| | | | | | Scorer 7 (optional) | | | | | | |
| | | | | | Scorer 8 (optional) | | | | | | |
| | | | | | Scorer 9 (optional) | | | | | | |
| | | | | | Scorer 10 (optional)| | | | | | |

### How it works:
- Scorer 3, 4, and 5 are mandatory for the candidate to seek and get scores from.
- Scorer 6 through 10 are optional. If the candidate feels it can improve the average by getting additional scores, they can find additional scorers.
- Scores will only be considered if the scores are given across all the parameters.
- Scores will only be considered valid when the scores are received from the respective Scorer's email ID.
- **Format of the email from Scorer:** It should just have one attachment, which is the excel file with naming as described in IMP NOTE above. Inside the excel file, there will just be one sheet with the above table, but only 1 row (depending of SCORER number).
- Any conflicts will be resolved by the Program Curator (which is me- Prafulla :D).

### Multipliers
| | Scorer weights | DRAAP weights | Delay weights |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Weight** | 0 for TDS1, 1 and increasing for TDS2 onwards. Increments in Geometric progression. | 1 for all, unless specified for a particular task | 1 till ETA, reduces below 1 for each day after ETA, in a Harmonic progression. |
